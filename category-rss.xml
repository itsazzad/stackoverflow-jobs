In the face of pressure, you&amp;rsquo;re a staunch navigator &amp;ndash; cool, calm, and collected &amp;ndash; steering the ship gracefully through the storm and distilling peril into long-term system advancements.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Possessing a myriad of tools at their disposal, engineers on this team are the technical experts for all of Quantcast&amp;rsquo;s mission-critical applications and services&amp;mdash;the tech stack that ultimately makes up our core revenue-generating products. In this role, you&amp;rsquo;ll become well-versed with our custom mapreduce technology and have the unique opportunity to learn the true meaning of &amp;lsquo;big data,&amp;rsquo; getting hands-on experience with an infrastructure that handles dozens of daily _petabyte-scale_ data processing jobs that run across a 10000+ core commodity compute cluster.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;In addition to keeping our existing business running smoothly (as if that was not enough!), this team provides the core function of bringing new applications to production quickly and reliably by providing guidelines, tools, scripts, and libraries that ensure they are fault-tolerant and scalable. What&amp;rsquo;s more, this team authors general purpose frameworks, dashboards, and utility programs to solve company-wide pain-points and will automate any and all operational work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Finally, this group of multi-disciplinarians is the catalyst, facilitating internal adoption and production-ization of early prototypes produced by our product development teams. The result is auspicious--an accelerated innovation and product cycle which gives Quantcast tremendous speed, flexibility, and a real advantage in a dynamic and rapidly evolving marketplace!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain, scale, and optimize existing mission-critical data pipelines and applications that makeup Quantcast&amp;rsquo;s core products&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Provide guidance on QC&amp;rsquo;s petabyte-scale data processing infrastructure and create tools, scripts, and libraries to fit pre-production applications to production&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Render fault-tolerance, monitoring, and alerting tools for various software development projects&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Build company-wide tools and automation in Java, Python, Ruby, C or bash&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Act as a Catalyst for Quantcast&amp;rsquo;s product development cycle&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Troubleshoot production issues and be part of 24/7 on-call rotation&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;Requirements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong utility player, versatile and capable of picking up new technologies quickly&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong Java development background;

Helping to transform the market requires software skills, analytical experience, business sophistication, and a genuine commitment to ethics and social responsibility. &amp;nbsp;Incorporated in 2000, Green River's team of 15 software engineers collaborates with clients including Starbucks, US Green Building Council, NBCUniversal, B Lab, and many others.

Together, we&amp;rsquo;ve created a collaborative atmosphere in our company--shaping together the kind of work and lifestyle we want and fostering career paths through mentorship. &amp;nbsp;This has resulted in exceptionally long-term relationships with both our clients and our staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for an individual who has experience with Rails, SQL, Javascript and CSS, and who can lead a programming team. &amp;nbsp;We offer a competitive salary with great benefits, including 100% of health insurance, five weeks paid time off, retirement benefits, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;As the population rises, the climate changes, and critical resource thresholds are reached and exceeded, it&amp;rsquo;s becoming increasingly important for information systems to help us obtain and interpret data about people and organizations, in terms of both economic benefits and human and ecological health. This vision of the future is what drives us at Green River.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look forward to hearing from you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="Green River" href="http://www.greenriver.com"&gt;Green River&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2015 20:52:48 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-01-02T20:52:48Z</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/47588/site-reliability-engineer-networking-stack-exchange</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/47588/site-reliability-engineer-networking-stack-exchange</link><category>cisco</category><category>haproxy</category><category>redis</category><category>windows-server-2012</category><category>sysadmin</category><title>Site Reliability Engineer, Networking at Stack Exchange (New York, NY) (allows remote)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Stack Exchange is growing fast, and our infrastructure needs just keep getting bigger. &amp;nbsp;We&amp;rsquo;re looking for a senior sysadmin to join our team of outstanding sysadmins and developers working on sites that see 3000-4000 hits per second during peak times.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;At Stack Exchange we&amp;rsquo;re passionate about our technology. &amp;nbsp;We&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/2011/11/17/why-stack-exchange-isn%e2%80%99t-in-the-cloud/" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;own and operate our own infrastructure&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;, and&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/2011/02/09/our-storage-decision/" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;take the time to do it right&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;* (even the&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.serverfault.com/2012/01/05/a-studied-approach-at-wifi-part-2/" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow"&gt;&lt;span&gt;office wifi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;). &amp;nbsp;We like to stay on the cutting edge of technology, so you will always being working with or working towards using the latest and greatest there is. &amp;nbsp;We get all the hardware we need for redundancy and performance,&amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;and we create our own tools when needed (like our&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="http://bosun.org/" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow" rel="nofollow"&gt;open source&amp;nbsp;monitoring&amp;nbsp;system&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;* Doing it right has the added benefit of reducing Sleep Interrupting Events (SIEs) when you are on call.

However, we're open to experienced engineers with other backgrounds, like Ruby.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Architecting and building out a public API, with throttling controls, rock solid security, and analytics to measure usage.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We're constantly optimizing for speed, as a way to deliver the best experience to both website users and native app users.

Now, the back-office system is in need of similar improvements. That's where you come in.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What a day in the office might look like&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;You start the day off with a stand-up meeting, where everyone discusses their recent activities and the tasks on the agenda for today. You went to see Jorieke yesterday, who is one of our conversion managers, to discuss how she could best create a new digital camera in our back-office system. Before you were going to work your magic this was a tedious job, so she is happy that this is about to be changed. You have directly translated her wishes into a wireframe, and today you will have the design tested by Jorieke.

Concerning the 3-tier application itself, we like MVVM, since it helps in making our applications loosely coupled.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Consume the data from our web services, so you can focus on creating an intuitive user interface.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Write testable code that will be continuously tested and deployed by TeamCity and Octopus Deploy, and will have a real effect on live environments.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Coach and provide feedback to fellow developers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Think about technical choices, such as our architecture, tools, processes.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;How will you be doing this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will actively participate in your multidisciplinary team's Scrum process.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will receive and pro-actively get feedback from end users and developers. After evaluation of this feedback you might incorporate it in a new iteration.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will actively think about technical choices, such as our architecture, tools and processes. Choices that were made in the past are not rules.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You open pull requests, review the code and give feedback that makes your team even better.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will perform code-reviews in order to provide feedback that makes your team even better, and to maintain a high level of quality in our code bases.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will work in a motivated team to deliver on sprint commitment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;You will actively improve overall software quality. Write SOLID and testable C# code.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;There is always a budget for good ideas.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What we have worked on last quarter&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creating an application with a slick and intuitive GUI for our financial department, which uses our SOA to consume and store the data, enabling them to perform the part of their day-to-day operations in regards to dealing with suppliers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What a day in the office might look like&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;Today is the first day of the new sprint. Yesterday you and your teammates demoed the work of the former sprint. The round of applause, the future users gave to your team was well deserved, since the WPF application is showing some serious advantages over the current way of working, and is looking very slick to beat. 'Sure', you think, the end result was good, but things could've gone a little better. In the retrospective following the demo you're able to praise the good end result and vent some constructive feedback. After the small replay in your head, you assign the top user story to yourself. The debtors from the financial department want to be able to approve or reject the agreements the purchasers create, in order to be a second set of eyes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You walk by the web services team, thinking that for now you're gonna have to mock the calls regarding the agreements, but the service containing the functionality has already been released. Attached to the user story is a smooth design, with new icons and storyboards. You spot the use of an element that doesn't exist in our WPF toolkit yet. You're going to take until lunch to decide how you will implement the control.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will be working in a dedicated and smart team with three to five other developers, each of them with their own specialization, ranging from XAML, the ins and outs of the upcoming C# 6, Unit tests and somebody who knows Git inside out. Your team will be complemented by a Scrum Master and a Product Owner. Each of these roomies will challenge you, both technically and in a game of Nerf.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We offer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Money.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;To help you keep your money, we also chip in on your pension, pay for your travels and offer a discount on all the stuff we sell.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Heartwarming help with the international relocation process from start to finish.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Room for you to do things your way.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;25 days of paid leave, so long as you promise to come back!&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;We like to inspire your passion giving you the opportunity to visit events.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Lots of things you can learn through our Coolcademy &amp;amp; skilled sparring partners.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;An office in the heart of Rotterdam so there's plenty to do when you're not at work.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Free beer, ping pong tables and awesome parties.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2015 11:52:48 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-01-02T11:52:48Z</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/77071/mobile-developer-adnry-advisory-sl-at</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/77071/mobile-developer-adnry-advisory-sl-at</link><category>xamarin</category><category>ios</category><category>android</category><category>rest</category><title>Mobile Developer at ADNRY Advisory S.L. at Bloombees (Madrid, Spain) (allows remote)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We are opened several positions, and we looking a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Xamarin / iOS Developers / Android developers for a long term project in Mid Town, Madrid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Responsabilities:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop native and mobile web applications targeting iOS, Android and Windows Phone.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Ios &amp;amp; Android programmers to Develop native applications.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;For Xamarin programmers to Develop mobile applications using Xamarin, including Xamarin Forms.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;To Connect with RESTful exrernal API's.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;To implement muti-language product.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design solutions to complex problems using industry best practices.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with project or product managers to define solutions, provide estimates, test, and implement the&amp;nbsp;final solution in production.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with senior developer to ensure company defined best practices are being followed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Participate in estimate calibration sessions used for Sprint planning in the SCRUM methodology.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Troubleshooting, performance tuning, and other related support tasks associated with day-to-day&amp;nbsp;management of production software.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;Design and implement best practice security and system architecture.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 02 Jan 2015 10:52:48 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-01-02T10:52:48Z</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/72584/platform-engineer-hailo</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/72584/platform-engineer-hailo</link><category>go</category><category>python</category><category>cassandra</category><category>rabbitmq</category><title>Platform Engineer at Hailo (London, UK)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;At Hailo, we understand that life is busy enough without the little everyday frictions getting in the way.

Our software engineers work at the tip of the FiscalNote spear, continuously aggregating large quantities of real-time open data. FiscalNote data scientists and policy experts rely on our software engineers to formulate and implement inventive methods of data collection in order to provide the top-tier analysis expected by our customers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Data acquisition is only the beginning, though.

You will be given the freedom to explore our business and our technology&amp;hellip; and make it better. Bureaucracy hinders your ability to develop and engineer great products and tools, so we&amp;rsquo;ve all but eliminated it.

Your appreciation (bordering on obsession) for clean code and attention to detail have helped you shine brightly at previous positions.

CareEvolution's Health Information Exchange (HIE) platform &lt;em&gt;creates better patient outcomes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our exchanges ingest clinical data from a wide variety of sources - claims, admissions, labs etc. - and supply interfaces by which clients can consume, modify, and aggregate that data in all sorts of interesting and meaningful ways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;One example problem that Health Information Exchange helps solve is&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;the lack of visibility across institutions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &amp;nbsp;Often, patient care is managed across multiple hospitals, clinics, and practices. Our platform allows caregivers -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;and patients themselves&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;- to access a patient's complete medical history across all institutions in the exchange. In other words the physician can see everything that's happened to the patient -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;cross-institution&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;- on&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;one screen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. &amp;nbsp;That kind of access and visibility empowers caregivers to give the most informed care possible to their patients.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Another:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;the prevention of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a title="Never Events" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Never_events"&gt;Never Events&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. One frequently-occurring Never Event is when a certain type of catheter remains in a patient for too long, in which case the risk of hospital-borne infection increases. If that happens, insurers will refuse to reimburse the hospital for the treatment of the infection, and so the hospital must shoulder the financial burden. &amp;nbsp;This expense can run tens of thousands of dollars&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;per patient&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;. It is therefore in the financial interest of the hospital to identify which patients are at risk, and to take corrective action. In this case - as is often the case - the financial incentives align very nicely with the mission of creating better patient outcomes. CareEvolution has leveraged many different components of our stack and leveraged all sorts of interesting data - labs, orders, nurse notes, financials, etc. - to create solutions for these types of problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;There are many other use cases for exchange - many of which we probably haven't even thought of yet. &amp;nbsp;But, in short, any opportunity in which we can create better patient outcomes is the business that we want to be in, and the business that we find ourselves in.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are looking for software people to help us solve these problems. Common themes include the expansion of our platform, the setting up and management of new and existing deployments, technical integration with 3rd-party data sources, and development of new applications atop our platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;But we're not going to tell you what to do. We're looking for people who will tell us what we will do - what &lt;em&gt;needs&lt;/em&gt; to be done and &lt;em&gt;why it's important&lt;/em&gt; - and then we're going to build something cool. &amp;nbsp;&lt;span&gt;We're engineered our organization specifically to engender creativity, innovation, and focus on solving some of the most difficult problems in healthcare. &amp;nbsp;Our team is intelligent, competent, focused, creative, kind, ... and humble. &amp;nbsp;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;Really!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;) &amp;nbsp;We have a flat,&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;manager-less&amp;nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;company structure - or, perhaps a different way of putting it is that &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; is a manager.&amp;nbsp; We exclusively hire smart&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;adults&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span&gt;&amp;nbsp;who can get things done, and who are committed to helping us solve these problems.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visit &lt;a title="http://letsfixhealthcare.com" href="http://letsfixhealthcare.com"&gt;http://letsfixhealthcare.com&lt;/a&gt; to learn more - or contact us - and we'll better explain what CareEvolution is all about.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2015 17:52:48 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2015-01-01T17:52:48Z</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/46307/software-engineer-javascript-sprout-social-inc</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/46307/software-engineer-javascript-sprout-social-inc</link><category>javascript</category><category>backbone.js</category><category>html5</category><category>css3</category><category>jquery</category><title>Software Engineer - JavaScript at Sprout Social Inc.

Drop your bag at your desk and head over to the colleague that has some questions. You'll spend a few minutes with him, before you need to get back for your 9:30 stand-up. Today you need to finish up the service for the purchasing optimisation team; you just need to finish up the test cases and push it into CI by the time you go for lunch - you chuck your headphones in and get on with it.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;You take a break for lunch at the Markthal with your newest friends; making sure that you're back in time for the meeting with a data engineer that will help you design a new replacement for the current integration with Oracle. You stop on the way back to grab another coffee and discuss the semantics of PUT vs POST with the team next door. You spend the remainder of your afternoon writing a blog post in the IT Wiki on the new queuing methodology you demoed last week, and then pack up and, because it's Friday, head out for a beer with your colleagues.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will be working in a team with a few other sharp developers, each of them with their own fanaticisms, ranging from code quality and testability, to algorithms and scalability.

You aren't looking at skills yet, you just want to get to know her. How would her personality mesh with the rest of the herd? Can she communicate ideas clearly and concisely? Can she talk fluently about the technologies Coolblue deploys? It's your shot at filtering out candidates that don't fit the mould. Not bad, not bad at all. She passes. For now. Of course, your senior team members will pick her apart technically later. Next stop: Helping Hans to get over his test writing anxiety. During your last sync, you only gave him two pointers: 1) find a way to pass dependencies into your code, and 2) find a way to break down your code into the smallest modules possible. You quickly scan the 'homework' he's handed in. No more static method calls, good. Got rid of those private and protected methods. Stopped creating new objects inside a method. Excellent. 'So, tell me. Why are these things barriers to having an easily-testable codebase?', you ask. And at this point, you're sure his answer won't disappoint.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;br&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;You'll lead a team of PHP developers with various levels of experience.

You don't ignore the lessons learned, however - even those learned by others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;You don't wait for things to come to you.

Allow us to introduce ourselves. We are Expensify and we do "expense reports that don't suck!" (Google "expensify" to read more.) We're getting crushed under an ever-growing pile of super awesome work, and I need one bright soul to help us dig our way out. I can guarantee you fun, an amazing opportunity to learn, and the siren's call of distant riches. But only if you are all of the following:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;- An incredibly hard worker, even when it's not so fun. There is a ton of work to do, and a lot of it downright sucks. After all &amp;mdash; we do the sucky work so our customers won't need to. I need you to buck up and grind through server logs, user emails, source code, and bug reports, without complaint or supervision, and come back asking for more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;- A cool person to be with. Not a crazy party animal, just someone we can trust, rely upon, hang out with, bounce ideas off of, and generally interact with in a positive way, both personally and professionally. In fact, this is one of the most stringent requirements we have: would you be fun to hang out with day and night on some remote, exotic beach? This isn't a rhetorical question, either: every year we take the company overseas for a month (on your own dime, sorry) and work incredibly hard while having a ton of fun. We've done Thailand, Mexico, India, Turkey, Croatia and the Philippines. Where do you want to go next?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Super talented, in a general way. We're going to throw a ton of work at you of every possible sort, and you need that magic skill of being able to figure it out even if you have no idea where to start. On any given day you might bounce between super low-level coding, super high-level technical support, marketing-driven data-mining, updating our user documentation, inventing/designing/building some new feature, etc. This is not a code monkey job &amp;mdash; you're going to be a full participant in the process, and you need to bring your own unique blend of skills to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Specifically talented in a programming way. You can instantly visualize solutions to problems big and small. Your code is always clean, well commented, has good nomenclature and indentation. You can switch on a dime between C++, PHP, Bash, Cron, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Dwoo, SQL &amp;mdash; not because you know them all, but because you're the sort of person who can just pick it up and figure it out. If you're this sort of person, you'll know what I mean. If not, then this position isn't for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;And there are a bunch more, but odds are if you got this far, nothing I can do would stop you from applying. That's a problem because while I know *you* are awesome, it's actually really hard and time consuming to find you in the midst of the literally hundreds of other applications I get from everyone else. So this is where I'm going to ask my first favor: can you make it really easy and obvious how great you are, so I don't accidentally overlook you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are probably many ways to do that. But the easiest way is to help me out by answering the following questions:&lt;br&gt; 1. What's the URL of your website? If you don't have one, why not?&lt;br&gt; 2. What's your coding history? When did you start, and what have you done between then and now?&lt;br&gt; 3. What do you want to do with the rest of your life, and how is Expensify a step toward your long-term goals?&lt;br&gt; 4. Tell us where you heard about this opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 29 Dec 2014 22:52:48 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2014-12-29T22:52:48Z</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/76975/full-stack-javascript-developer-addictive-mobility</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/76975/full-stack-javascript-developer-addictive-mobility</link><category>node.js</category><category>mongodb</category><category>socket.io</category><category>websocket</category><category>jshint</category><title>Full Stack JavaScript Developer at Addictive Mobility (Toronto, ON, Canada)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;We are looking for a web developer well-versed in JavaScript to help us build a next-generation dashboard for mobile advertising.

We have 2 pretty big projects going and are looking to bring on someone to help us to move faster...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project #1 started a few years ago. It is a bidding &amp;amp; proposal tool that revolutionizes the outbound service industries we have targeted including automated follow-up and reporting on how to close more jobs within individual businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;Project #2 is a really awesome job application tool. We would have loved to use it for this particular job opening, but since the bugs are bound to create more frustration than it would solve... but it's getting closer every day! This tool would allow businesses to be able to disrupt the whole online form system by being able to ask questions in the form of video or text and respondents would be able to use video to text to respond. It will make the whole application process much smoother and flow directly into the interviewing process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We need developers who can help us to scale this business quickly and in a really fun way since our roadmap is so incredibly long.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point every developer needs to be a "full-stack" developer since we are still so small. Everyone will be doing back-end work, front-end work and even a bit of dev-ops for a while. We're pushing hard to get to where development will be more segregated, but since the position we are hiring for will be able to say they were here back in the day when you had to know everything... we gotta hire that person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;A culture fit is most important for us.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;And we are a startup...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;So if you have another job, we won't have our feelings hurt.

Our system involves wearable devices, field deployed base stations and radios, cloud servers, standard browser front ends. It could possibly end up with Unity native frontends, feedback through the wearables, more sensors for inanimate objects, radio analysis, etc. We will be looking into bringing in additional data from existing APIs around the web as well as some more interesting places, i.e. let&amp;rsquo;s make a crane talk to our servers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;You will have the opportunity to work with a variety of databases, embedded systems, web, native, and embedded user-interfaces, and more. Clearly one developer is not going to know every language and technology we end up using from day one. This means that there will be a lot of learning on the job and plenty of room for influencing architecture and technology choices.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;About the Environment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;We have one developer (the guy writing this) and one hardware engineer (the CEO) at the moment so you will be joining a very early team. Our customers are companies and there are a bunch of wonderful folks working on the business side getting us very impressive partners and interesting sites to beta test and develop the product with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;We will be handling very high volumes of data very early on and so the quality threshold of certain parts will be higher than that of most early stage systems. Even though are moving fast we will also be building our processes and culture and we&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone who is excited to help us do that.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Responsibilities&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Building and expanding our distributed service-oriented/API-driven architecture &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Coding the wearable tech and base stations&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Scaling our data collection capabilities &lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Helping build and expand our analytics and event engine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span&gt;Many, many other things&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 18 Dec 2014 15:52:48 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2014-12-18T15:52:48Z</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/76563/devops-engineer-casenex</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/76563/devops-engineer-casenex</link><category>chef</category><category>puppet</category><category>python</category><category>shell</category><category>cloud</category><category>sysadmin</category><title>DevOps Engineer at CaseNEX (Charlottesville, VA)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;A passionate DevOps Engineer looking to work in a meaningful field.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About Us&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;An education start-up based in Charlottesville, VA with offices in California and NYC too.

No one candidate will cover the gamut of what we do, and as you are able to &lt;br&gt;contribute particular skills in some of the areas we cover, we will fit you in where you can best express your skill - there is plenty of work to go around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look for candidates who want to join for the long haul; on the way toward that goal some period of contracting while we feel each other out could be fine. Working from home some of the time is also quite acceptable for the right candidates.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Dec 2014 21:52:48 Z</pubDate><a10:updated>2014-12-16T21:52:48Z</a10:updated></item><item><guid isPermaLink="true">http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/76381/full-stack-developer-lamp-befunky-inc</guid><link>http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/76381/full-stack-developer-lamp-befunky-inc</link><category>php</category><category>lamp</category><category>mysql</category><category>javascript</category><category>jquery</category><title>Full Stack Developer (LAMP) at BeFunky Inc (Portland, OR)</title><description>&lt;p&gt;BeFunky, the popular photo editing platform with 25M+ users, is on the hunt for a new Full Stack Developer (LAMP) that will be located in its beautiful Portland, OR office.
